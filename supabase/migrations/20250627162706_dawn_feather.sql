  # Fix remaining incorrect original_title values and force re-enrichment

  1. Problem
    - Some movies still have incorrect original_title values that don't match the actual movie
    - This causes wrong posters to be displayed
    - Need to reset these movies to force re-enrichment with correct TMDB data

  2. Solution
    - Identify movies where original_title clearly doesn't match title
    - Reset their TMDB data to force re-enrichment
    - Use negative TMDB IDs to trigger enrichment script

  3. Impact
    - Movies with mismatched titles will be re-processed
    - Correct posters and data will be fetched from TMDB
