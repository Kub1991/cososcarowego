/*
  # Enable public updates for last_selected_at tracking

  1. Problem
    - Frontend app (using anon key) cannot update last_selected_at column
    - Current RLS policies only allow authenticated users to modify movies
    - This prevents fair movie selection tracking from working

  2. Solution
    - Add new RLS policy for public users to update ONLY last_selected_at and updated_at
    - Use WITH CHECK to ensure no other columns can be modified
    - Maintain security while enabling selection tracking

  3. Security
    - Policy ensures only specific columns can be updated
    - All other movie data remains protected
    - Only movies that are Oscar nominees can be updated (additional safety)
